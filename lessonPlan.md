# Setup 

npm install --save-dev jest

alter test script in package.json to read jest

1. Start with the functions in function.js then import into functions.test.js 

- simple example passing two numbers

- add test that passes in string and let the test fail

- then refactor to let the test pass

2. Next write tests in functions.test.js for the arrays and the objects

3. Then do setup and tear down for tests

- start by doing two related tests outside of group

- then group tests using a describe block
